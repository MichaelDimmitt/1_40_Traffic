## "1:40_Traffic, Redlight aware road software."
<pre>
	Did your Traffic Light turn red?
Actually, we already knew that.

(1) we know your traffic light turned red.
(2) we know your distance from the traffic light
(3) we know your speed.

(a) magically! from your distance ... slow to this speed- 
and on a max 1:40 traffic light ... your light will be green!
</pre>


#### lastly, is the max_traffic_light_time in your area 1:40_seconds?
<br>you may, as a user configure the max_traffic_light_time accordingly.

<pre>thought on cruise_control
cruise_control should notify rear drivers of two things.
(1) should affirm cruise_control is activated.
(2) should have a seperate warn/attention sign 
	if (car in front is within danger distance of the cars current speed) </pre> 


came up with a new algoritm shown by two examples.
leaves.. blow across the road by the force of cars. But when it is raining leaves persist.
ice shutdown cities.. short snow .. not salted(lack supplies) .. warms(snow melts) cools ... (water freezes)

programming applications to be determined but ... my hunch is that it is a pressure algorithm.
also this looks fun.. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Transportation/Traffic_Signals
